# WaitER

Waiter is an application that helps to reduce wait times in the ER by giving a patient priority
data based on nurse triage. It sends text messages to patients letting them know how long their
wait will be. If the the patient is low risk and they have a long waiting time, they may choose
to leave the spot in the ER queue. This will reduce pressure on the ER staff and their resources, reducing the wait times in the ER.
